## Lessons learned

From this project, I learned that Kotlin is easier to use than Swift. It is very similar to Java which made it simpler for me to work with. Android Studio, however, was
slow to work with. The startup sometimes took very long and it gave me strange errors from time to time. Also, the layout is a little complicated to work around. 
Nonetheless, it a good IDE with many convenient features that grew on me over time. Seems like it offers everything needed to develop for Android and I look forward to using it again soon.
The task list application turned out to be a great way to learn about the basic concepts like the built-in Kotlin functions and methods. It's a good foundation to building more complex apps.
In the beginning, I had to research some things like how passing intents between activities worked, but once I understood it, it became intuitive. Overall, a good first experience with Kotlin and Android Studio.
